# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This document outlines the plan to transform the existing Flutter application into a production-grade product. The goal is to create a robust, scalable, and maintainable application that adheres to best practices in Flutter development.

## Current State

The application has been refactored into a production-grade architecture with a clear separation of concerns. The UI is visually appealing and the codebase is organized and maintainable. A GitHub workflow has been added to automate testing.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Foundational Setup

*   **Dependency Management:** Added `provider` for state management and `google_fonts` for custom typography.
*   **Project Structure:** Organized files into a logical structure:
    *   `lib/src/app.dart`: The root widget of the application.
    *   `lib/src/screens/home_screen.dart`: The main screen of the application.
    *   `lib/src/providers/theme_provider.dart`: Manages the application's theme.
*   **Theming:** Implemented a centralized theme using Material 3, `ColorScheme.fromSeed`, and `google_fonts`.
*   **State Management:** Introduced a `ThemeProvider` using the `provider` package to manage light/dark mode.

### 2. UI/UX Enhancements

*   **Home Screen:** Designed a visually appealing and user-friendly home screen with a card-based layout and a placeholder image.
*   **Theme Toggle:** Added a button to switch between light and dark themes.

### 3. Code Quality and Best Practices

*   **Code Organization:** Refactored the code into separate files for better readability and maintainability.
*   **Comments:** Added descriptive comments to the code to improve understanding.
*   **Linting:** The project is ready for the implementation of strict linting rules.
*   **Testing:** Added a widget test to ensure the application is working as expected.

### 4. Automation

*   **GitHub Workflow:** Added a GitHub workflow to run tests automatically on every push and pull request to the `main` branch.

### 5. Next Steps

*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling mechanisms.
*   **Update README:** Provide a comprehensive `README.md` with instructions on how to run the app.
